Gravity simulation using laplacian and FFT solver written in javascript, and winh browser visualization.

# Introduction
Newtonain gravity can be solved by solving a gravitational field equation.

![Gravitational Field equation](http://latex2png.com/output//latex_9781037c37b2d51d9ab5c859e85f1787.png)

this is a poisson equation which can be solved numerically using an FFT.
